The item must direct to a List.

The List referenced must be well formatted, that is, it contains all intended metalist fields.

The governor of the list must not be malicious.

The parameters of the list must allow challengers to profit over successfully challenging items. Under regular conditions:
- The cost of creating a dispute must be lower than the required stake that will be awarded to challenger upon a win. Gas and arbitration fees are the parameters to consider.
- The arbitrator and arbitratorExtraData must be able to finish challenges in reasonable lengths of time, according to the nature and complexity of the items.

The *List Policy* should be comprehensive.

About projects that will encompass many specific lists, each one of those lists should not be included in this registry. Instead, a List-Of-Lists that compilates all the specific lists should be made, and that List should be registered instead.
- Example: if you make a protocol that holds many whitelists of social media profiles, (No Spam, English, Crypto Developer...), instead of submitting every whitelist, you make a Parent List such as *Social Media Whitelists*, submit your whitelists to it, and then submit the Parent List to this registry.
